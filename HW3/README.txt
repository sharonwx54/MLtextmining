SUMMARY
================================================================================
The python environment I use is Python 3.7.15. It runs on Google Colab with GPU access. The requirement packages are listed in colab_requirement.txt. 

The code could also run successfully in Python 3.10.6 under PyCharm C/E, with macOS Monterey (M2 Chip). The run time would be very slow due to CUDA not available on M2 Chip. The requirement packages are listed in requirement.txt

To execute in command line, simply call python run_nn_models.py
